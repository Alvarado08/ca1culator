[The Odin Project Foundations Course Final Project](https://www.alvarado08.github.io/ca1culator/) consisted in making a Calculator with simple operations and additional extra credit challenges! This was the perfect project to test out my new superpowers! After a few hours of struggle and moments of staring into the screen, I'm really proud to say that I managed to wire things together and bring this to life.

- Perform basic operations
- Handle decimals and round results
